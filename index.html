        <h1> Crops and Livestock Commodities in Australia </h1>
        <p>Agriculture is an important part of Australia's economy. It accounts for around 11 per cent of goods and services
          trade, adds around 2.6 per cent of all employment, and exports goods to other countries as well. Farming in Australia can 
          be broken down into two big sectors; Plant and Animal derivatives. These sectors fluctuate much from state to state, territory to territory, as much of the land in Australia
          is unarable, and different states having different conditions that would best fit to certain commodities.

        <p><small><i>NAPLAN is a nation-wide standardised test of numeracy and literacy conducted in years 3,5,7 and 9.
              We calculate NAPLAN
              score by aggregating the state governmentâ€™s data on the percentage of students that met or exceeded
              expectations for their year level.
            </i></small></p>

        <p>
          Here, the correlation is more apparent. The LGAs that
          perform better on the NAPLAN tests tend to have less bullying, across all years. This indicates that children
          who
          apply themselves at school and/or environments that value education result in less bullying in class.</p>

          <h2>Trends across Genders</h2>
          <p>One interesting trend is that bullying rates have decreased across the years in all regions and genders. Of
            note
            is that the bullying rate in boys is now 1.9% lower than that in girls, despite starting 2.2% higher. This
            change
            occurred between 2010 and 2011. We speculate that this may be due to the popularisation of social media
            around this
            time, allowing for different avenues of bullying, such as cyberbullying, to emerge. </p>

          <h2>Melbourne Metro Region</h2>
          <p>The Melbourne metropolitan region has generally reported lower bullying rates than across the state,
            despite
            having a range of NAPLAN scores (see above). This may be due to a variety of factors as any factor that
            attracts
            families to the city could be an explanation. Some possible examples are the parents education and
            profession,
            the funding of the school in question, or even the immigration status of students.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within metropolitan Melbourne, KNOX reported the most bullying in 2016 at 22.6%, and Stonnington the least
            at 6%.</p>

          <h2>Decline in Bullying</h2>
          <p>Finally, inspecting the nine most populous LGAs, we find that there has been substantial improvement across
            the years.
            Across all nine LGAs, less than one in five students report having experienced bullying recently, a
            significant improvement. </p>
          <p>
            Melbourne, in particular, has always had low bullying numbers, but has since been joined by Monash; both at
            one student in every eight.
